      My name is Tyner. I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.
       This website is a slow-growing collection of written works that I have created since 2020.
      This blog serves friends and family predominately.
       I make no attempt to market or publish anything relating to this website anywhere.
       If you have stumbled across this page: Welcome!

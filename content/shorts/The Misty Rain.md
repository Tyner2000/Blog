title: A Misty Rain.
---

The sound of a cool misty rain as it falls atop a once bright tin plated roof is nothing if not calming. In this moment it could not be more what he needed to sooth his rather unfavorable mood. The birds softly began chirping, the grasshoppers provided the melody, and the bullfrogs in the nearby pond came out, bringing with them the loud bass rhythm of the forest. Despite the rain's having been noticed by all sorts of creatures around the secluded cabin, he glooms on, oblivious. That is to say, he was oblivious up until the racket of frogs had begun their croaking.

Slowly as though from a deep sleep, he begins to stir in his chair, and an equal stirring in his mind begins. His noticing the frogs' croaks had left in his ind a sort of irritation, a feeling which was quickly replaced with another. The calming feeling of the pit-pitter-patter of the rain as well as the songs of the birds had finally rectified his mood. He no longer felt the weight on his mind of whatever it was he had been thinking so deeply of, and decided to come out to observe the rain more closely.

The man steps outside, and having only just noticed the rain a moment ago, he is still in awe of its beauty. He turns his chin upward to gaze at the sparsely clouded grey sky and marvel at the droplets as they fall. They seem to just appear above him and splash back down around him, both by his feet and on his face. He turns to look at his cabin and his eyes follow some of the droplets on their descent. He watches as they form tiny rivers and deltas, turning the pale green patina on his roof into a more vibrant emerald color.

As he stands there, the songs of the birds had become louder without his notice. The wind picks up and the rain begins to feel more like that of a proper downpour. Taking one last moment to savor the cool, misty air, he settles back on his heels and jogs up the porch steps and into a cozy wooden chair. He hadn't quite been soaked by the rain, but wet enough that he had considered heading straight back into the cabin to change his clothes. The grandeur of his forest kept him outside and, albeit a little damp, he was quite happy.

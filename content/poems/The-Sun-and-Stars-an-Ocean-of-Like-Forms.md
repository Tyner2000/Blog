It stretches on and into the night,  
it is truly the greatest sea.  
Dotted and dashed with twinkling lights  
its wonders never cease.  


In the day it's brightly lit,  
the nemesis of the dark.  
The sky stays blue so long as it  
stays inflamed by its spark.  
So rarely are they found together  
that the sun and stars remained  
an elusive thing whose truth we never  
thought we might attain.  


And so it stands that modern man has seen what was not shown,  
that the sun and stars are just the same, and together they share a home.

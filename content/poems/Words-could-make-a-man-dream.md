It was on this night  
a young man learned --  
his ears alight,  
but not having heard  
and instead seen --  
that these volumes of words  
could make a man dream --  
and make a soul bright.


From that novel he lifted  
at an old corner store  
his thoughts only drifted --  
and his mind wanted more.

A star should stand forever still.  
Sometimes however, a rogue one will  
leave for lands far from home  
and end up there -- all alone.


Past legends have often told  
of falling stars and truths they hold,  
but those stars that remain  
will -- forever in vain --  
try to make the night's sky whole.

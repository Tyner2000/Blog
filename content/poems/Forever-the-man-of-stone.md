Shadows draw long from the limbs of trees  
as the sun sinks softly down low.  
Night closes in, and he shivers from the cold.  
One thing is certain -- that he never chose  
this path for himself. For he  
never dreamed to be  
forever this man of stone.  


And so the mountain stands alone.  
His strength, however evident --  
reminds him -- as he stands in reverence  
that this place is not his home.
